# backend/app/services/content_generator.py
"""
content_generator.py - single GPT call for all lecture content.

Produces in one API call:
  - master_summary   (markdown, structured sections)
  - flashcards       [{front, back}] x 10-20
  - quiz             [{question, options[4], answer, explanation}] x 5-12
  - glossary         [{term, definition}] x 10-20

Checks DB cache before calling GPT - skips if all fields already populated.
Caller (job_queue worker) is responsible for saving results to DB.
